# Decoding Cybercrime: Uncovering Trends and Patterns in India Using Machine Learning

This project analyzes motive-wise cybercrime data across Indian states (2016–2020) to identify regional patterns, correlations with IT sector growth, and cluster states based on behavioral profiles. The goal is to support data-driven, region-specific cybercrime policy recommendations.

## 📊 Project Objectives
-	Analyze motive-wise trends in cybercrime across Indian states.
-	Investigate the relationship between IT sector growth and total cybercrime cases.
-	Apply unsupervised machine learning (KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering) to group states by similar cybercrime behavior.
-	Generate cluster-wise policy recommendations based on behavioral profiles.


## 📁 Dataset Sources
