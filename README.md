# Decoding Cybercrime: Uncovering Trends and Patterns in India Using Machine Learning

This project analyzes motive-wise cybercrime data across Indian states (2016–2020) to identify regional patterns, correlations with IT sector growth, and cluster states based on behavioral profiles. The goal is to support data-driven, region-specific cybercrime policy recommendations.

## 📊 Project Objectives
	•	Analyze motive-wise trends in cybercrime across Indian states.
	•	Investigate the relationship between IT sector growth and total cybercrime cases.
	•	Apply unsupervised machine learning (KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering) to group states by similar cybercrime behavior.
	•	Generate cluster-wise policy recommendations based on behavioral profiles.


## 📁 Dataset Sources
	•	Cybercrime Motives (2016–2020):
	•	Source: data.gov.in
	•	Publisher: National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB)
	•	Contains state-wise cybercrime counts by motive.
	•	IT Sector Growth:
	•	Source: Press Information Bureau (PIB)
	•	Year-wise IT sector revenue used as a proxy for digital expansion.

	•	Python 3.9
	•	Libraries:
	•	pandas, numpy – Data preprocessing
	•	matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization
	•	scikit-learn – Clustering and regression
